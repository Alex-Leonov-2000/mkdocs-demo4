  <h1>Childhood</h1>

<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Brooklyn, New York City, on February 17, 1963,[30] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[30][31] He has two older brothers, James Jr. and Larry, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.[32][33] Jordan and his siblings were raised Methodist.[34]</p>
<p>In 1968, the family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina.[35] Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School, where he played basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short.[36][37] Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.[36] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[37] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.[38] As a senior, he was selected for the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[39][40] after averaging 26.8 ppg,[38] 11.6 rebounds (rpg), and 10.1 assists per game (apg) for the season.[41]</p>
<p>Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[42] In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where Jordan majored in cultural geography.[43] He chose this field of study because of its relationship to meteorology, as Jordan was interested in a career as a meteorologist.[44][45]</p>
<h2 id="college-career">College career</h2>
<p>As a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after averaging 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[46] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[48][49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, Jordan averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.[14]</p>
<p>Jordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.[50][51] After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina a year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986,[52] when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[53][54] In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[55]</p>
<h2 id="professional-career">Professional career</h2>
<h3 id="chicago-bulls-19841993-19951998">Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)</h3>
<p>Early NBA years (1984–1987)
The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[56] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[57] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[58]</p>
<p>Jordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.[59] During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting,[46]. He helped the Bulls improve from 28–54 to 38–44 and turned them into playoff contenders. Jordan quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.[60][61][62] Roy S. Johnson of The New York Times described Jordan as "the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls" in November,[62] and he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading "A Star Is Born" in December.[63][64] The fans voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.[5] Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[5] This led to a so-called "freeze-out" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him.[5] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.[65] The Bulls finished the season 38–44,[66] and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[65]</p>
<p>An often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985,[38][67] when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk.[68][69] The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan's rise.[69][70] The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers.[71][72] Jordan's 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[73] The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record,[66] at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[74] Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor's single-game playoff scoring record.[75] The Celtics team, though, swept the series in three games.[65][75][76]</p>
<p>Jordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season,[77] and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting.[46][78] Jordan also demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[79] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[80] The Bulls reached 40 wins,[66] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.[65]</p>
<h3 id="pistons-roadblock-19871990">Pistons roadblock (1987–1990)</h3>
<p>Jordan led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,[46] and won his first league MVP Award. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg),[81][c] and leading the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.[83] The Bulls finished 50–32,[66] and made it past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[84] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[65] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the "Bad Boys".[85]</p>
<p>In the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8.0 rpg and 8.0 apg.[46] During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago's point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.[86]</p>
<p>The Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,[66] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.[87] The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit "The Shot" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[88] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[65] by utilizing their "Jordan Rules" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[5]</p>
<p>The Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson.[89] On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers.[90] He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg,[46] in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.[66] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers;[91] despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[65]</p>
<h3 id="gambling">Gambling</h3>
<p>During the 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.[111] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[112] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.[113] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling,[114][115] but the rumor spread widely.[116]</p>
<p>In 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated:</p>
<p>Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.</p>
<p>When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: "No."[117] In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of Jordan Rides the Bus, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research "convinced [him it] was nonsense".[116]</p>
